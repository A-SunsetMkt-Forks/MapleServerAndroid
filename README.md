# MapleServerAndroid - MapleStory v83 server on Android

## Introduction
A Maplestory GMS 083 server on Android based on Cosmic Maplestory project.

## Important
1. It takes about 1 minutes for the server to start after clicking the Start button.  
2. Server config locates in assets/config.yaml and is copied to internal app storage during apk installation, you can change the server config just like Cosmic/HeavenMS by clicking ServerConfig.  
3. Mysql is replaced by sqlite to guarantee the performance. I'm not an expert on sqlite and I replaced SQLs by using ChatGPT, there might be some errors, please raise issue when you find a bug.

Beware - ***This server emulator is not production ready.***
It can be useful for testing things locally or for trying out ideas, but launching a new private server based on this and opening it up to the public
without knowing what you're doing is not recommended.
